I’m mainly known online as **HRSVRN**.  

Currently, I work as a **Machine Learning Engineer at Mecha Systems**, where I build **LLMs** and **Computer Vision systems** for the **Mecha Comet**, an embedded handheld computer.  

Previously, I interned at **Monkhub Innovations** as a **Machine Learning Engineer**, where I worked on **LoRA, YOLO, and RAG**.  

My main focus is on **Computer Vision** and optimizing its efficiency, but I’m open to exploring everything related to **AI**.
